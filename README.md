# selfPractice-1_1
Self_practice project

** Version 1.0.0 **

This is my first php practice project.

To use this code you have to follow some step:
1. Start Apache and phpmyadmin from xmapp.
2. File location must be "xampp/htdocs/.."
3. Create a database and name it 'practice_php'.
4. Create a table in that database and name it 'self_practice_1_0'.
